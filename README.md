# word-ladder

Let W be a dictionary of words. If w and w' are in W, we say they are doublets if w and w' are equal length and if there is a sequence of words such that the previous word in the sequence differs by only one character. 

An example of such a sequence is given by turning pig into sty:

pig
wig
wag
way
say
sty

This program uses a breadth first search of a dictionary to findout if two words are doublets. 
This program is not yet optimal.
